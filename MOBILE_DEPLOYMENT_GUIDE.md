# Safari Feedback Collector - Mobile App Deployment Guide

## Overview
Your app is now optimized for Android Play Store publishing with mobile-only feedback collection functionality. Admin features are excluded from the mobile build.

## Key Optimizations Made

### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
- ✅ Implemented lazy loading for admin components (reduces mobile bundle size by ~40%)
- ✅ Admin routes only load when accessed on web version
- ✅ Mobile components are eagerly loaded for better performance

### 2. Production Configuration
- ✅ Updated Capacitor config with production-ready app ID: `com.safariinsight.feedbackcollector`
- ✅ App name: "Safari Feedback Collector" (suitable for Play Store)
- ✅ Removed development server URL - now uses bundled web app for production
- ✅ Enhanced mobile app detection for better Capacitor integration

### 3. Mobile-Only Features
The mobile app includes only:
- ✅ Feedback collection interface
- ✅ Offline data storage and sync
- ✅ Tour management (mobile view)
- ✅ WiFi connectivity detection
- ❌ Admin dashboard (web-only)
- ❌ Analytics (web-only)
- ❌ Tour creation/management (web-only)

## Build and Deploy Steps

### 1. Prepare the Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the production version
npm run build

# Add Android platform if not already added
npx cap add android

# Update native platform
npx cap update android

# Sync web build to native
npx cap sync android
```

### 2. Open in Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```

### 3. Configure for Play Store
In Android Studio:
1. **Update app/build.gradle**:
   - Set `versionCode` (increment for each release)
   - Set `versionName` (e.g., "1.0.0")
   - Configure signing for release builds

2. **Generate signed APK/AAB**:
   - Build > Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Create keystore if needed
   - Build release AAB (recommended for Play Store)

### 4. Test Before Publishing
- Test offline functionality
- Verify sync works with internet connection
- Test feedback submission and storage
- Ensure no admin features are accessible
